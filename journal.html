		ACCEPTING MY FLAWS x FUTURE : 
		This song is on Future's latest album "High Off Life" and it is definetly my favorite. I enjoy the intro, because it gives a personal insight to the song's meaning. "You could be right here with a mother fucker but you don't wanna be here with a mother fucker" gives me the vibes of being angry with feeling alone, which is exactly how I feel. This whole songs kinda hits every prominent emotion I am currently feeling. "Missin' out on real love" is my favorite line because I actually got booed up during quarantine, but my booski is in NYC and I've been here in GA for 3 months, so I feel like I'm missin out on real love, even though the communication growth has been so dope. Alongside that growing relationship, I also feel like he's accepting my flaws and I'm accepting his. Dope. Thank you Future boo bae.

	<h2> Day 2 :</h2>
	<p class="prompt">
		What have you learned about romantic relationships from personal experience? What about from observing others? 
	</p>

		Currently, I have learned that communication is everything. Being able to communicate your feelings and trust someone enough to handle your feelings with love, care, and respect. That also comes with being comfortable being vunerable. That's the only way you'll really get to build a romantic relationship with someone. Don't let fear of it stop you! I used to do that and I avoided new relationships at all costs. I have definetly gotten better, but still working on being more open to more people. It is also tiring, but worth it. 
		I've also learned especially from my parents that a true relationship (or maybe I'm talking about marriage now lol) comes with problems and you can't just say fuck it when problems arise, because they will. Relationships come with hard work, love is easy but relationships are hard, there's a big difference. That's why I think it's so hard for a lot of people to realize when love is toxic. Because love is easy!

		WHat up Rach from the present, this is Rach from the past here. Life is extremly weird right now. I am living, alongside the world, in the midst of a pandemic. A very confusing, untruthful one at that. I don't feel like I am living in fear, if anything I sort of feel like the opposite. I have had so much time and space to let my mind go where it needs to go and face what it needs to face without the distractions of everyday things, responsibilties and mundaneness. I have definetly learned the extent of my patiences and that continues to grow, because I honestly don't have any other choice. It's what's best for me. I'm also ~ boo'ed ~ up ~. Who the hell would've thought, after 5 years of being single after my first young love, I find romance during a godforsaken pandemic. And I am in a different state. I haven't seen him in almost 4 months. But you know what's so dope about it? We've really really gotten to learn and appreciate our communication. I have learned so much about him and we have become so open and we haven't even seen each other! The powers of true communication! How beautiful! I have been more chatty than ever, at least when I get the chance to be. I obviously spend a lot of time alone, but We (I this is weird) both know that I love and cherish and value my alone time. Because I am not lonely. I truly am not. I am surrounded by love. Love from my family love from my true friends AND new love! I have found new love of cooking, reading, sewing, and of course making lists. HOW amazing. Be proud of yourself. Be courageous like you always have. Be creative with the restrictions you have no control over. Be you!!! You rock! and yes of course, you've had your fair shares of <em> extremely </em> low times but shit you sure as hell have learned a lot from it. Life is so beyond intresting right now, and very unsuring which is frightning, but I will lead, I am leading, and have lead with hope and I will never stop doing that. This is all happening for a reason and I am forever beyond grateful for my situation and health and family's health, that is all I ask for in a time like this. GODSPEED COVID-19. 
		Lead with hope.

	<h2> Day 5 : </h2>
	<p class="prompt">
		What do you think is the #1 thing you get upset about? Why does it effect you so much? How can you better cope with these situations?

		Right now, I am definetly most upset about the racial unjustice in America. I am baffled at how wide my eyes have just RECENTLY been fully opened. I think the biggest way I will cope with is is to continue to inform myself everyday and spread knowledge, information, TRUTH, and educate those around me in my life and throughout my world, this world, this extremely FUCKED up world. I think also taking care of myself. Doing activites and things that help me decompress and relieve the emotional tension and stress I have been feeling. This is definetly one of the thingsl lol. And I think also, continuing my support and promotion of anti-racism and black justice even AFTER all of the attention within the media, conversations, etc dies down, I honestly hope it doesn't, the flame that is now lit, due to the anger and sorrow and PAIN felt by black people is well over-due, this was bound to happen and I believe that CONTINUING the strength of support, help and love by non-black people and white people is what is really going to promote change. The CONTINUING of EDUCATING youth, and all white non-black people of our privledge, and putting an END to WHITE SUPREMACY AND RACISM because I DO NOT want to live in a world where that exists, I DO NOT want my BLACK neighbors, friends, family, co-workers, etc, to live in a world where that exists, I DO NOT want my CHILDREN or ANYONE'S CHILDREN to live in a world where that exist. THE TIME FOR CHANGE IS NOW. 
		I am coping, I am taking care of myself so I can take care of those I love.
